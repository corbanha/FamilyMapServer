# familymapserver
Family Map Server was a final project for my Advanced Programming Concepts class. It involved creating a local server in Java which supported all of the main CRUD restful functions (Create, read, update, delete).

Additionally the project included creating a companion Android app from scratch which connected to the server via http requests and fetched data of fictious users.

The app itself is a family history app (family history info fake generated). It starts with a standard login/register screen, which when the user logs in connects shows the user a map with all of their ancesters' main events up to four generations back. Lines are drawn cooresponding to the users' life events, following up their family tree, and a line drawn to their spouse's birth they have a spouse.

When a user clicks on an event pin on the map, it brings up another screen with details about that person including their birth, marriage, death and close family members. The app also supports a detailed search capability, settings, and sort screens for added customization.

Overall it was a really fun project to make!
